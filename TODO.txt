The expected results are in the folder in SimpleTest.    These work in CPP.

In other languages, may need to alter the create list of list to an object static method.   
    **** 

    

Steps:


Change name of tmpl file to cpp.tmpl 


Then check out.     

Will not need header file for the test file, since gtest calls it.   

1. Need to add creating a header file to match the methods that are being output. 
    Do this in parallel as each method is added.  
    Need namespace surrounding everything.   and "end namespace"
    test_header()     data_header() or something like that 
    The header will have a .h.tmpl on it. and the other with .cpp.tmpl 
    *** Mostly done 
2. All files must have #include pch.h -  NO **** 
3. Change every creation method to match what is in the expected result file.
4. Update the data types.
    int, char, float, bool, double, void, wchar_,  
    short, long, long long, unsigned for all of these 
    *** Check this 

4. Then start on example.featurex and then the remainder.  
    **** Started,  need some work - ID basically.   
        Take out include "data.h" for the data construct 


Add the other test frameworks (gtest, MSTest, etc.  whatever they have)
    MSTest will need to have some major changes (where to do namespaces and end up the 
        classes)
